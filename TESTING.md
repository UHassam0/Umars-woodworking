# Testing

### Responsiveness Testing

I have been able to use the site on my phone with no issue and have used chrome developer tools and the mockup generator linked in credits to test this and spotted no issues

### Bugs Resolved and Unresolved

collectstatic match cloudinary to workspace especially overwrite/replace style.css from walkthrough
not auto completing slug on create projects page
not notifying user when projects created - although takes back to manage projects and shows it there at the top
homepage horizontal scroll required
cancel button on edit

### Lighthouse testing

Lighthouse scoring is dropping slightly on the performance due to image files size. This is only on the manage projects page(lighthouse screeecnshot below). Going forward images uploaded should definitely be compressed and perhaps look at alternatives to Cloudinary. However, this is not currently a significant problem
